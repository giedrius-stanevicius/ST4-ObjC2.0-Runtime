All of the files in 'compiler' now compile.
All of the files in 'debug' now compile
none of the files in 'gui' compile
1 file in 'misc' that won't compile (objectModelAdaptor)
4 files in 'main' that won't compile (STGroup, STGroupDir and STGroupFile and Interpreter).

Then the hard work begins, finding any and all bugs in translation.

Do you have any testing files that I should convert to test with?
